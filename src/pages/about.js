        Hello! Thank you for your interest in my work. These pages represent my
        photography practice both as a form of creative expression and as a
        documentary tool. My background in art instilled a deep appreciation for
        nuanced meaning in imagery that remains with me today. I studied
        photography at University of the Arts in Philadelphia (BFA '05), and
        stay connected with my alma mater as an instructor in Continuing
        Studies. I find it truly inspiring that everything we know about the
        universe essentially comes from humans observing closely and analyzing
        that information over generations. We have so much incredible knowledge,
        and at the same time, impenetrable mysteries remain. My current vandyke
        brown print series, Wild Gravity, celebrates the intersections of
        science, spirit, curiosity, and strangeness. Connect with me on
        Instagram below to see what I'm working on next.
